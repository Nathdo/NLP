# NLP

**In this project, I am applying NLP techniques to analyze the text of messages. The 'label' column classifies each message as either spam or ham. The 'message' column contains the text content of each message. The 'length' column indicates the total number of words in each message, and the 'punct' column quantifies the punctuation marks used.**

**My goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify spam messages based on these features. By examining the word count and punctuation patterns, I aim to train the model to recognize the typical characteristics that differentiate spam from ham messages. This approach is crucial for improving email or messaging filtering systems by effectively filtering out unwanted spam messages.**

**The project involves preprocessing the text data, extracting key features (like word count and punctuation), and training a machine learning model on these features to classify the messages. I plan to evaluate the effectiveness of my model using various metrics to ensure it achieves high accuracy and minimizes false positives in spam detection.**
